# Candlestickmaker
Demonstration of a Bokeh streaming & patching OHLC chart using fractally generated data.

#### Running

To view the app directly from a Bokeh server execute the command:

    bokeh serve --show /path/to/directory/candlestickmaker
    
or possibly if you downloaded a .zip file:
    
    bokeh serve --show /path/to/directory/candlestickmaker-master
    
    
    
This should open a browser window and after a few seconds the plot will begin to update.  Sufficient data is generated to run the simulation for 100 x 10 second candles.
