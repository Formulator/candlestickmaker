Demonstration of a Bokeh streaming & patching OHLC chart using fractally generated data.

#### Running

To view the app directly from a Bokeh server execute the command:

    bokeh serve --show /path/to/directory/ohlc_RT
    
This should open a browser window and after a few seconds the plot will begin to update.
